# Proxy server

* Two types: forward and reverse

### Forward

* For non-developers, a forward proxy is much more well known
* A forward proxy acts on the behalf users when accessing the internet
* Used by client computers

### Reverse

* A reverse proxy acts on behalf of servers
* Eg. nginx redirecting HTTP requests to a Node app on port 8080
